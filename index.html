        <div class="subheading mb-5">Elementary Teacherüçé</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first year at University of California, Riverside. I come from a Korean-American background, and my hometown is San Jose, California. My favorite color is lavender. I love to play sports, especially soccer. I also did track and cross country in high school. I enjoy travelling with my friends and taking photos to share my memories with others. During my free time, I love to go cafe hunting and try every oat milk latte that I could possibly find. With my mother being a babysitter, I grew up being surrounded with babies. I loved helping my mother take care of them, and a they got older I was able to teach them things. My interest in helping kids never went away, and my dream has always been to have my very own classroom. I am majoring in Liberal Studies in pursuit of elementary teaching. I also plan on attending graduate school to get my teaching credential and master's degree altogether. I am interested in being a teacher in America as well as in South Korea. I have a lot of hands-on experince with helping kids both locally and internationally.   <br><br>

        I spent part of my senior year of high school as a student teacher for my former second grade teacher. I helped with lesson planning for the second grade students as well as read and alanyze books with them. I also have experience with decorating the classroom with students' artwork. While the teacher kept the class under control, I would assist her in photocopying homework pages or lesson plans so that she can get started immediately. I am well aware of how to stay organized with my duties as a teacher. For two years, I was also the second grade girls' teacher for Awana Clubs. I helped them memorize bible verses from a booklet which leveled them up to the next. In addition, I have been to Cambodia and Mexico as a missionary to teach students English. I prepared lesson plans as well as craft activities to do with them. Coming from a different country, I learned how to care for the kids despite the language and culture barrier. <br><br>

        As an undergraduate student striving to become an elementary teacher, I believe that I am well educated on the duties I have to fulfill as one. From my experience with kids, I know how to remain patient when they struggle with what is being taught. I am aware that little kids have a hard time sitting still, so I know what to do to make learning fun for them. I have the skill to maintain a classroom full of little kids and know how to be spontaneous with my lesson plans according to how they receieve it. Not only do I have skills of a teacher but I also know how to be a mentor figure to them through my actions and words. I am clean, organized, and a committed individual, and I am sure that I will keep my classroom a safe place for kids.
